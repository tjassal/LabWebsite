					<description><![CDATA[Hi George,

I&#039;m sorry to hear about the issues. I haven&#039;t worked with ncpdq, but seems like a linux based solution would be more robust than my work-around above. It sounds like you can import the netcdf data to an array and reorganize as necessary, but it&#039;s not very efficient for your data?

Good luck,
Tim]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim,
I am having the same problem: the dimensions of a 3-Dimensional netCDF file are read in the wrong order by raster. 
Working with the nco commands (e.g. ncpdq) I have been trying some things, but nothing is working. The problem really seems to be the raster package.
Your solution is fine, but doesn&#039;t scale well with file-size.

If you have another idea, let me know please.
Regards,
George]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tim, 
Thank you very much for the quick response. Will try with ‘gdalUtils’ package.
Best, 
Nabin]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nab-

I&#039;m glad you found the code helpful.  I&#039;m certainly not an HDF export, but it is my understanding that HDF files can be read by ncdf4 if the HDF files were written in accordance with netCDF-4 rules. If not, that might explain the HDF error you have received. 

You might consider using the &#039;gdalUtils&#039; package instead of ncdf4 to import the HDF file into R; convert to a raster and be on your way. This post should help with that:

					<description><![CDATA[thanks for the code..extremely helpful. I have a netcdf file (berkeleyearth) data covering 2000 - 2009 , not able to open showing HDF error ? Any guidance please ... One more doubt how to extract data for area of interest ? I am using a polygon ( shape file) to extract this...but unable to create array. Again many thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been brought to my attention that the &quot;ncdf&quot; package has been removed from the CRAN repository. 

Please use the &quot;ncdf4&quot; package and update the code accordingly to enable the above example to work:

Code block 1: library(ncdf4); nc &lt;- nc_open(&quot;fm100_2003.nc&quot;);

Code block 4: array1&lt;-ncvar_get(nc, dname);

Thank you.]]></description>
