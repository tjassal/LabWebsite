								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several large and destructive wildfires burned parts of San Diego County in mid-May. I must admit I do not track wildfires as closely as I should unless they are in close proximity to the Front Range of Colorado, where I live. However, I have relatives that live in San Diego County and have visited the area several times so I dedicated a bit more attention to these fires. The Poinsettia fire burned a small area in Carlsbad, while the Cocos fire burned south of San Marcos and the Bernardo fire east of Solano Beach. A recent Landsat 8 image, acquired on May 25th, captured the impact of the fires on the landscape after all three were fully contained. The Cocos and Bernardo fires were large and left a fairly conspicuous scar on the landscape. However, the Poinsettia fire scar is difficult to identify at a regional scale in a natural color Landsat image. This is in large part because the fire was only 600 acres in size. However, it is also difficult to identify in the matrix of urban, suburban and exurban elements of the landscape in northern San Diego County. The Poinsettia fire started in a small urban park in a highly populated area (the cause is still under investigation and arson has not been ruled out).</p>
<p>The image below utilizes the two shortwave-infrared bands and the near-infrared band on the Operational Land Imager sensor onboard Landsat 8. The fire scars are much more conspicuous in the false color image compared to the natural color image (below), especially the smaller Poinsettia fire scar. The near-infrared band is sensitive to living vegetation whereas the shortwave range is sensitive to ash, char and water content. Both of these ecosystem properties are impacted by fire, therefore the burn scars jump out of the false-color image.</p>

<p>This prompted the question, where is the Wildland-Urban Interface in this area? The Wildland-Urban interface (or WUI) is generally defined in the Federal Register as &#8220;the<br />
area where houses meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation.&#8221; The WUI is a nexus between human-environment issues (such as habitat fragmentation) and natural hazards (such as wildfire risk). Specifically theÂ WUI must meet or exceed a minimum density of one structure per 40 acres. In their 2005 Ecological Applications paper, Radeloff et al., conducted a spatially detailed assessment of the WUI across the United States. They utilized census block data and vegetation cover information (National Land Cover Data) to identify the WUI. I queried their updated 2010 data to identify WUI and non-WUI areas in the vicinity. The map below identifies the Cocos and Bernardo fire scars are partially within the WUI, but the Poinsettia fire scar is located completely outside the WUI. The area in the vicinity of the Poinsettia fire does not meet the requirement of the WUI due to the absence of natural vegetation which serves as fuel. The assessment of wildland fire risk is very complex and involves many factors in addition to proximity of the WUI. The Poinsettia fire illustrates that areas outside of the WUI are clearly at risk if fire weather, ignition and vegetative fuels are present.</p>

<p>An image from the Thermal Infrared Sensor (band 11) identifies the hotspots (dark blue) associated with the burn scars of the three fires. All of the fires were contained when the image was acquired. However, recently burned areas contain blackened soils with little vegetation that quickly heat up compared to other areas. Lighter colors indicate lower relative temperatures in the image associated with water and vegetation.</p>
