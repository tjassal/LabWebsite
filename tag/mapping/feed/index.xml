								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The open access journal <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Sensing</a> has a call for papers related to remote sensing of wildfire. The topics of interest are diverse, ranging from wildfire risk to the ecological effects of fire. Full details can be found <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing/special_issues/wildfire_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="si-deadline">Deadline for manuscript submissions: <b>30 June 2018</b></span></p>
<div>
<p>Wildfires (which include forest fires, grass fires, brush fires, bush fires, and peat fires, among others) are an integral part of so many ecosystems across the world. In general, these fires are primarily viewed negatively despite their favorable contributions. Here, the purpose is to gather scientists/researchers related to this topic, aiming to highlight ongoing research investigations and new applications in the field. In this framework, the editors of this Special Issue would like to invite both applied and theoretical research contributions; submissions of original works furthering knowledge concerned with any aspect of the use of remote sensing in wildfires. Note that these manuscripts must be, not only unpublished, but also not under consideration for potential publication elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts must employ one of the following remote sensing data types: Optical, thermal, hyperspectral, active and passive microwave acquired by either airborne or spaceborne remote sensing platforms, dealing with wildfires. The topics of interest include, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehending of the pre-fire conditions,</li>
<li>Forecasting of wildfire danger/risk,</li>
<li>Modelling of wildfire behavior,</li>
<li>Fighting the wildfire,</li>
<li>Modelling prescribed burning,</li>
<li>Relation between vegetation phenology and fire,</li>
<li>Monitoring of the vegetation recovery following the fire events,</li>
<li>Mapping of burn area and ecological impacts,</li>
<li>Modelling of smoke propagation, and</li>
<li>Analyzing of historical fire regimes, among others.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sublette County, Wyoming has undergone recent land use change in the form of heightened rural residential development on private land and increased energy development on both public and private land. Quantifying landscape change as a result of energy development is not particularly new. Likewise, recent studies have made advances in quantifying residential development over time. However, much of the literature on this subject is related to urban, suburban and/or exurban development. Mapping rural residential development using multi-temporal and multi-spectral imagery has not received much attention. Nearly two-thirds of the population of Sublette County resides in unincorporated areas where such growth has occurred. Energy development within the county has exponentially increased in recent years. Both of these phenomena create changes on the landscape that can be measured over time using remote sensing. The results serve as important baseline data that can be incorporated into land use planning and ecological-wildlife research at the landscape scale.</p>
<p>In a new article in the <a title="Journal of Maps" href="http://www.journalofmaps.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Maps</a>, my co-author and I integrate energy production data, population census data, ownership parcel data, and a series of Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper scenes (over a 25 year period) to create a map that illustrates the changing landscape. This work was done in part to support the <a title="WLCI" href="http://www.wlci.gov/" target="_blank">Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative</a>. The paper was published in the special issue “Mapping Innovations in Spatial Demography,” (December 2012) and can be accessed at: <a title="JOM Article" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2012.745381" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2012.745381</a> or <a title="JOM Manuscript" href="https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/23538/23538.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Publications/23538/23538.pdf</a>).
