								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Earth Engine</a> (GEE) is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis which uses a JavaScript API and an online IDE code editor. In short, you can utilize remotely sensed imagery available in Google&#8217;s cloud to run analyses without downloading the data to your local machine. You&#8217;ll need to sign up as a developer to gain access <a href="https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Below is an example from an upcoming lecture to the Anthropology and Geography group of the <a href="https://socialsciences.calpoly.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Sciences Department</a> at Cal Poly University. In my talk I showed an example of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for Cal Poly&#8217;s campus. Here I&#8217;ll demonstrate the workflow I used to create NDVI using GEE with data from the cloud.</p>
<p>To execute the example below, please download the campus shapefile <a href="https://tjassal.github.io/LabWebsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CalPoly_campus.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (originally obtained from the <a href="https://afd.calpoly.edu/facilities/mapsplans/cadfiles/map/gis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campus website</a>). You&#8217;ll need to upload the shapefile into GEE using these <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/importing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> (see the &#8220;Uploading table assets&#8221; section) and load the data into your script using these <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/asset_manager#importing-assets-to-your-script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> (see the &#8220;Importing assets to your script&#8221; section). If you&#8217;d like to run the example without downloading campus data, skip to the second code block below.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the following code into the Code Editor of GEE:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">// Load four 2016 NAIP quarter quads, different locations.
var naip2016 = ee.ImageCollection('USDA/NAIP/DOQQ')

  .filterDate('2016-01-01', '2016-12-31');

// Spatially mosaic the images in the collection and display.
var mosaic = naip2016.mosaic();

// Get information about the bands as a list; prints in console at right
var bandNames = mosaic.bandNames();
print('Band names: ', bandNames); 

//Get the projection of Band 1
var b1proj = mosaic.select('B').projection();
print ('Band 1 projection: ', b1proj);

<p>We recently published a paper in the journal <a title="RSL Site" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/trsl20/current#.VduxYZe1a6E" target="_blank"><em>Remote Sensing Letters</em></a>, entitled “Mapping forest functional type in a forest-shrubland ecotone using SPOT imagery and predictive habitat distribution modelling.” Our study area is located in the southern portion of the Wyoming Basin Ecoregion centered on several prominent forested ridges surrounded by shrubland. Although the forests are extensive in some areas, they are characterized by small, isolated patches that act as islands in a sea of sagebrush. The forest-shrubland ecotone (or transition area) provides habitat for many different species and therefore it is important to have accurate data on the type, size and extent of forest type.</p>

<p>However, in heterogeneous ecosystems such as the one, <a href="https://tjassal.github.io/LabWebsite/?p=1064" target="_blank">regional and national land cover mapping products typically lack the spatial resolution needed to adequately characterize the extent and juxtaposition of land cover</a>. We present a framework that incorporates aerial photos, satellite imagery and topographic information to model dominant forest cover at local scales across a forest-shrubland ecotone.</p>

<p>The driving concept of the analysis was to exploit phenological differences in forest cover type by “viewing” the forest at different times of the year. Phenology is the study of the timing of specific biological events, such as plant flowering, animal migration, reproduction, etc. The phenological event of interest in our study is leaf drop by deciduous trees in autumn. Simply put, deciduous forests look different to our eyes (and satellites) in the summer than they do once the leaves turn color and fall off in autumn. Deciduous forest and coniferous forest look slightly different during the summer, but they look very different after deciduous leaves fall to the ground. In our study area, the iconic Quaking aspen tree is the sole deciduous forest type. Satellites can differentiate between vegetation types based on the amount of radiation that is absorbed or reflected which is different when there are leaves on the trees compared to when the leaves are off the trees. In our study we interpreted forest cover type in aerial photos and used this to “scale-up” the information to satellite imagery. We developed probability of occurrence models for both deciduous and coniferous forest, and then combined the model outputs into a synthesis map depicting forest cover type.</p>

<p>The output of this project provides valuable information that we used in <a href="https://tjassal.github.io/LabWebsite/?p=1129" target="_blank">subsequent research to assess the effects of drought on forest community type</a> in this semi-arid region (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716000189" target="_blank">Assal et al. 2016</a>). The results from our analysis are suitable to characterize the extent and juxtaposition of forest cover in a highly heterogeneous ecosystem (see below). The input data we used in the models has a resolution of 10 meters and the output synthesis map has an overall classification accuracy of 87%. This approach enabled us to capture the extent and pattern of broad forest and very small and isolated patches that are missed by regional land cover data. Furthermore our framework utilizes open access aerial photos (source: <a title="NAIP INFO" href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/index" target="_blank">National Agriculture Imagery Program</a>) and satellite data (source: <a title="SPOT NA Data Buy" href="https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SPOT_NADB" target="_blank">SPOT5 – North America Data Buy</a>). In this way, it is transferable to other highly heterogeneous ecosystems to develop critical baseline tree cover data that can be updated at regular intervals to monitor the effects of disturbance and long-term ecosystem dynamics. Finally, our analysis addressed spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models (SDMs). Spatial autocorrelation is often ignored in SDMs and there is not a lot of literature on how to test for it in logistic regression models. It is my hope that this paper provides information on both aspects of spatial autocorrelation.</p>

<p>The availability of land cover data at local scales is an important component in forest management and monitoring efforts. Regional land cover data seldom provide detailed information needed to support local management needs. Here we present a transferable<br />
framework to model forest cover by major plant functional type using aerial photos, multi-date Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) imagery, and topographic variables. We developed probability of occurrence models for deciduous broad-leaved forest and needle-leaved evergreen forest using logistic regression in the southern portion of the Wyoming Basin Ecoregion. The model outputs were combined into a synthesis map depicting deciduous and coniferous forest cover type. We evaluated the models and synthesis map using a field-validated, independent data source. Results showed strong relationships between forest cover and model variables, and the synthesis map was accurate with an overall correct classification rate of 0.87 and Cohen’s kappa value of<br />
0.81. The results suggest our method adequately captures the functional type, size, and distribution pattern of forest cover in a spatially heterogeneous landscape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently published a new paper in the journal <a title="RSE December 2014" href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/remote-sensing-of-environment" target="_blank"><em>Remote Sensing of Environment</em></a>, entitled “Modeling a Historical Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreak Using Multiple Lines of Evidence.” We have developed a new method for reconstructing past (1970s) bark beetle outbreaks using a novel combination of aerial photography and Landsat imagery. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire fire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for beetle outbreak severity.</p>
<p>The driving concept of the analysis was to map tree mortality in aerial photos and “scale-up” the information to a time series of satellite images. Color-infrared photography utilizes areas of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not visible to the human eye. Living vegetation absorbs blue and red light energy, while radiation in the green and near-infrared portion of the spectrum is reflected. Therefore, the reflectance captured in color-infrared photos can be used to distinguish between areas of live trees and dead trees (see the figure below). Satellite images do not contain the detail of aerial photos, but they allow us to track the reflectance of an area, known as the spectral trajectory, over time. The changes in a spectral trajectory provide clues as to the condition of forest with regard to mountain pine beetle activity.</p>
<p>This project is a critical first step in our overall goal to identify the ecological consequences of the interactions of bark beetles with subsequent fire events over the last several decades in the US Rocky Mountains. The work presents a quantitative application of remote sensing to forest disturbance and is timely given the recent mountain pine beetle outbreak throughout western North America. Furthermore, we believe the paper establishes a platform for future research of historical forest disturbance that would be very beneficial to the field of forest ecology.</p>

<p><strong><em>Manuscript Abstract</em></strong></p>
<p>Mountain pine beetles are significant forest disturbance agents, capable of inducing widespread mortality in coniferous forests in western North America. Various remote sensing approaches have assessed the impacts of beetle outbreaks over the last two decades. However, few studies have addressed the impacts of historical mountain pine beetle outbreaks, including the 1970s event that impacted Glacier National Park. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for outbreak severity. We incorporate historical aerial and landscape photos, aerial detection survey data, a nine-year collection of satellite imagery and abiotic data. This study presents a remote sensing based framework to (1) relate measurements of canopy mortality from fine-scale aerial photography to coarse-scale multispectral imagery and (2) classify the severity of mountain pine beetle affected areas using a temporal sequence of Landsat data and other landscape variables. We sampled canopy mortality in 261 plots from aerial photos and found that insect effects on mortality were evident in changes to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time. We tested multiple spectral indices and found that a combination of NDVI and the green band resulted in the strongest model. We report a two-step process where we utilize a generalized least squares model to account for the large-scale variability in the data and a binary regression tree to describe the small-scale variability. The final model had a root mean square error estimate of 9.8% canopy mortality, a mean absolute error of 7.6% and an R<sup>2 </sup>of 0.82. The results demonstrate that a model of percent canopy mortality as a continuous variable can be developed to identify a gradient of mountain pine beetle severity on the landscape.</p>
