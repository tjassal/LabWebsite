<p>In our new paper, published in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal of Biogeography</a>, we investigate postfire regeneration patterns of <em>Araucaria</em><em>‐</em><em>Nothofagus</em> forests on the west slope of the Andes Mountains in the Araucanía region of Chile. Specifically, we: a) used satellite data and ground measurements to evaluate the relationship between remotely sensed burn severity and forest mortality; and b) assessed controls of burn severity on forest regeneration at local spatio‐temporal scales. The paper is a product of a collaboration with Colorado State University (<a href="http://www.biogeography.colostate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Sibold</a>) and the and Universidad Austral de Chile (<a href="http://www.forestal.uach.cl/instituto/conservacion-biodiversidad-territorio/academicos/mauro-gonzalez.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mauro González</a>).</p>

<p>We think this work is noteworthy because 1) to our knowledge this is the first study that connects field-measured data with satellite-derived burn severity in this corner of the world; 2) one of the primary species of study, <em>Araucaria araucana</em> (known commonly as monkey puzzle tree), is recognized as an endangered species on the <a href="https://www.iucn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> <a href="https://newredlist.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red List</a> and faces a plethora of threats; and 3) the framework relies on open data, namely Landsat satellite imagery, and could be applied to long-term monitoring or assessment of similar ecosystems. I would go a step further and argue the availability of Landsat data was the primary reason we were able to get this project off the ground.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our new paper, lead by my colleagues at Colorado State University and published in the journal <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a>,  investigates the short-term compounded effects of spruce beetle and wildfire in subalpine forests in southwestern Colorado. We think this work is noteworthy because areas that were more heavily affected by spruce beetle corresponded to reduced post-fire vegetation. These results suggest vegetation recovery processes may be negatively impacted by severe spruce beetle outbreaks occurring within a decade of stand-replacing fire. Much of the current subalpine forest in this region has been impacted by recent beetle outbreaks. In the future, these areas could experience higher burn severity which has important implications for the structure and composition of future forests.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The open access journal <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Sensing</a> has a call for papers related to remote sensing of wildfire. The topics of interest are diverse, ranging from wildfire risk to the ecological effects of fire. Full details can be found <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing/special_issues/wildfire_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><span class="si-deadline">Deadline for manuscript submissions: <b>30 June 2018</b></span></p>
<div>
<p>Wildfires (which include forest fires, grass fires, brush fires, bush fires, and peat fires, among others) are an integral part of so many ecosystems across the world. In general, these fires are primarily viewed negatively despite their favorable contributions. Here, the purpose is to gather scientists/researchers related to this topic, aiming to highlight ongoing research investigations and new applications in the field. In this framework, the editors of this Special Issue would like to invite both applied and theoretical research contributions; submissions of original works furthering knowledge concerned with any aspect of the use of remote sensing in wildfires. Note that these manuscripts must be, not only unpublished, but also not under consideration for potential publication elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts must employ one of the following remote sensing data types: Optical, thermal, hyperspectral, active and passive microwave acquired by either airborne or spaceborne remote sensing platforms, dealing with wildfires. The topics of interest include, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehending of the pre-fire conditions,</li>
<li>Forecasting of wildfire danger/risk,</li>
<li>Modelling of wildfire behavior,</li>
<li>Fighting the wildfire,</li>
<li>Modelling prescribed burning,</li>
<li>Relation between vegetation phenology and fire,</li>
<li>Monitoring of the vegetation recovery following the fire events,</li>
<li>Mapping of burn area and ecological impacts,</li>
<li>Modelling of smoke propagation, and</li>
<li>Analyzing of historical fire regimes, among others.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several large and destructive wildfires burned parts of San Diego County in mid-May. I must admit I do not track wildfires as closely as I should unless they are in close proximity to the Front Range of Colorado, where I live. However, I have relatives that live in San Diego County and have visited the area several times so I dedicated a bit more attention to these fires. The Poinsettia fire burned a small area in Carlsbad, while the Cocos fire burned south of San Marcos and the Bernardo fire east of Solano Beach. A recent Landsat 8 image, acquired on May 25th, captured the impact of the fires on the landscape after all three were fully contained. The Cocos and Bernardo fires were large and left a fairly conspicuous scar on the landscape. However, the Poinsettia fire scar is difficult to identify at a regional scale in a natural color Landsat image. This is in large part because the fire was only 600 acres in size. However, it is also difficult to identify in the matrix of urban, suburban and exurban elements of the landscape in northern San Diego County. The Poinsettia fire started in a small urban park in a highly populated area (the cause is still under investigation and arson has not been ruled out).</p>
<p>The image below utilizes the two shortwave-infrared bands and the near-infrared band on the Operational Land Imager sensor onboard Landsat 8. The fire scars are much more conspicuous in the false color image compared to the natural color image (below), especially the smaller Poinsettia fire scar. The near-infrared band is sensitive to living vegetation whereas the shortwave range is sensitive to ash, char and water content. Both of these ecosystem properties are impacted by fire, therefore the burn scars jump out of the false-color image.</p>

<p>This prompted the question, where is the Wildland-Urban Interface in this area? The Wildland-Urban interface (or WUI) is generally defined in the Federal Register as &#8220;the<br />
area where houses meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation.&#8221; The WUI is a nexus between human-environment issues (such as habitat fragmentation) and natural hazards (such as wildfire risk). Specifically the WUI must meet or exceed a minimum density of one structure per 40 acres. In their 2005 Ecological Applications paper, Radeloff et al., conducted a spatially detailed assessment of the WUI across the United States. They utilized census block data and vegetation cover information (National Land Cover Data) to identify the WUI. I queried their updated 2010 data to identify WUI and non-WUI areas in the vicinity. The map below identifies the Cocos and Bernardo fire scars are partially within the WUI, but the Poinsettia fire scar is located completely outside the WUI. The area in the vicinity of the Poinsettia fire does not meet the requirement of the WUI due to the absence of natural vegetation which serves as fuel. The assessment of wildland fire risk is very complex and involves many factors in addition to proximity of the WUI. The Poinsettia fire illustrates that areas outside of the WUI are clearly at risk if fire weather, ignition and vegetative fuels are present.</p>

<p>An image from the Thermal Infrared Sensor (band 11) identifies the hotspots (dark blue) associated with the burn scars of the three fires. All of the fires were contained when the image was acquired. However, recently burned areas contain blackened soils with little vegetation that quickly heat up compared to other areas. Lighter colors indicate lower relative temperatures in the image associated with water and vegetation.</p>

<p>This post was originally published on the <a title="SOGES HumanNature Blog" href="http://blog.sustainability.colostate.edu/?q=content/sustainability-space" target="_blank">HumanNature blog </a>hosted by the <a title="SOGES" href="http://sustainability.colostate.edu/" target="_blank">School of Global Environmental Sustainability</a> (SOGES) at Colorado State University. I was as a Sustainability Leadership Fellow at SOGES during the academic year of 2013-2014. My fellowship cohort contributed blog posts that described the connection between our research and sustainability. Below, I highlight the value of the Landsat program and the contribution that remote sensing has and will continue to make toward sustainability research.</p>
<p>Environmental sustainability requires a balance between economic and social development while ensuring environmental protection. Monitoring of our planets resources is therefore a critical component in the realm of sustainability. We live in a world faced with uncertainty of climate change and rapid population growth, both of which contribute greatly to increasing pressure and competition for natural resources. Over the last 40 years, a growing network of satellites orbiting high above the earth has played an increasingly vital role in global change research. Currently, there are approximately 120 earth observing satellites, each providing a unique birds-eye view of the planet. The images captured by these satellites are more than just pretty pictures. They are records of the Earth’s surface and can reveal what is hidden from our view, enabling us to track changes in the global ecosystem over time. For a thorough treatment of the subject, I would encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/earth-from-space.html" target="_blank">NOVA’s recent special</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, one of the newest satellites in orbit, Landsat 8, beamed back its first images after launch in February. The imagery provided by Landsat is not quite as sophisticated as some of the other satellites of the last decade. However, the commencement of Landsat 8 is a significant event because it continues the longest running enterprise of satellite imagery which began during the Nixon administration. Any major event since 1972 that left a mark on the planet larger than a soccer field was likely captured by Landsat. The true value lies in the temporal resolution associated with the data collection (every 16 days). Landsat reached new heights in 2008 when the USGS released the entire <a href="http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">archive to the public</a>, free of charge. Given the imagery is readily available and covers large areas where ground access can be difficult, it’s no surprise there has been a sharp increase in multi-temporal remote sensing studies. The journal Remote Sensing of Environment dedicated a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442571200034X" target="_blank">special issue</a> to the legacy of Landsat in 2012.</p>
<p>I suspect I was more excited than most about the new satellite because this type of data is central in my work. I research how disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks and drought impact our forests. I use remote sensing to investigate the connection between historical pine beetle damage and wildfire in Glacier National Park, as well as drought stress in semi-arid woodlands in Wyoming. Disturbances have always been a natural occurrence in forests; however, global climate change is expected to increase the extent, frequency and severity of future disturbances. I use remote sensing in part to uncover when, where and why these changes took place. Disturbance alters forest ecosystem structure by both abrupt, conspicuous change and by gradual, slow change over some period of time. Such impacts allow remote sensing to capture the pre and post landscape and detect changes that might not be readily observed, such as drought stress. Through assembling multiple snapshots in time, we can begin to answer more difficult questions regarding the severity of a disturbance and the recovery trajectory for a given area.</p>
<p>I use many different types of remotely sensed data in my work, but Landsat is always my “go- to.” My work often involves a retrospective analysis of an event and I believe one project epitomizes the utility of Landsat. My advisor and I are working with a colleague at the Universidad Austral de Chile to quantify forest mortality in Tolhuaca National Park. This understudied national park in south-central Chile and an adjacent national forest reserve experienced a devastating wildfire in 2002. We were able to utilize Landsat imagery from before and after the event to calculate the extent and severity of the fire. We are validating our model through field data of canopy mortality and studying the regeneration of key species that will determine what the future forest will look like. The durability of the Landsat program allowed this particular project and so many more to come to fruition. As a write this column millions of pixels are waiting patiently in the archive to help the next scientist tell a story.</p>
