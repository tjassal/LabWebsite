<div class="abstract">
<p><b>Background/Question/Methods </b>Native bark beetles are capable of causing widespread mortality during outbreak events in the forests of western North America. These disturbances can have vast effects on forest structure and there is concern that such changes could influence subsequent wildfire behavior and its impact on ecosystems. New research has considered the recent mountain pine beetle outbreak (~1996-2006), but few studies have analyzed the ecological legacies of historic events. Northern Rocky Mountain forests were impacted by a widespread mountain pine beetle outbreak in the late 1970s through the early 1980s. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the historic beetle outbreak and other biophysical variables on the burn severity (derived from Landsat data) of 11 different fires in Glacier National Park over an 18-year period (1988-2006). The extent and arrangement of these disturbances presented a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of an earlier disturbance on ensuing wildfires. We used sequential autoregression to obtain accurate estimates of model parameters given the high level of spatial autocorrelation associated with wildfire. Models included additional explanatory variables known to influence burn severity such as topography and fuel moisture and variables were evaluated at increasing spatial scales.</p>
<p><b>Results/Conclusions </b></p>
<p>The models explained between 54% and 80% of the variability in burn severity of each fire. Historic mountain pine beetle severity was a significant predictor of burn severity in 10 of the 11 fires. The relationship between beetle severity and burn severity was positive across all models and we found no relationship between the effect size of beetle severity and time since the beetle outbreak. However, our results suggest the influence of the beetle outbreak on burn severity is scale-dependent on the pattern of beetle intensity. Fires where beetle severity was the best predictor at broad scales tended to have a larger beetle effect size compared to fires where local beetle severity was the best predictor. A number of factors, including topography and weather, are responsible for the burn severity associated with a given fire. However, our work shows an historic high severity beetle outbreak can influence the burn severity of wildfire for many years after the initial disturbance event. Furthermore, our analysis of historic events can shed light on future compounded disturbances as much of the landscape impacted by the recent beetle outbreak moves beyond the gray phase.</p>

<p><strong>THE ECOLOGICAL LEGACIES OF DROUGHT, FIRE, AND INSECT DISTURBANCE IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN FORESTS</strong></p>
<p>Temperate forest ecosystems are subject to various disturbances including insect agents, drought and fire, which can have profound effects on the structure of the ecosystem for many years after the event. Impacts of disturbance can vary widely, therefore an understanding of the legacies of an event are critical in the interpretation of contemporary forest patterns and those of the near future. The primary objective of this dissertation was to investigate the ecological legacies of drought, beetle outbreak and ensuing wildfire in two different ecosystems. A secondary objective of my research was motivated by a lack of available data which precluded investigation of each disturbance.</p>
<p>I studied the effects of drought on deciduous and coniferous forest along a forest-shrubland ecotone in the southern portion of the Wyoming Basin Ecoregion. The results show that forests in the region have experienced high levels of cumulative drought related mortality over the last decade. Negative trends were not consistent across forest type or distributed randomly across the study area. The patterns of long-term trends highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent and vulnerable to severe drought.</p>
<p>In the second thread of my dissertation, I used multiple lines of evidence to retrospectively characterize a landscape scale mountain pine beetle disturbance from the 1970s in Glacier National Park. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance was a major data gap since wildfire had removed some of the evidence from the landscape. I used this information to assess the influence of beetle severity on the burn severity of subsequent wildfires in the decades after the outbreak. Although many factors contribute to burn severity, my results indicate that beetle severity can positively influence burn severity of wildfire. This is likely due to the change in forest structure in the decades after the outbreak and not as a direct result of tree mortality from the outbreak. The long-term perspective of this study suggests that ecological legacies of high severity disturbance may continue to influence subsequent disturbance for many years after the initial event. This work also provides insight on future disturbance interactions associated with the recent mountain pine beetle outbreak that has impacted tens of millions of hectares in western North America over the last two decades.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently published a new paper in the journal <a title="RSE December 2014" href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/remote-sensing-of-environment" target="_blank"><em>Remote Sensing of Environment</em></a>, entitled “Modeling a Historical Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreak Using Multiple Lines of Evidence.” We have developed a new method for reconstructing past (1970s) bark beetle outbreaks using a novel combination of aerial photography and Landsat imagery. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire fire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for beetle outbreak severity.</p>
<p>The driving concept of the analysis was to map tree mortality in aerial photos and “scale-up” the information to a time series of satellite images. Color-infrared photography utilizes areas of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not visible to the human eye. Living vegetation absorbs blue and red light energy, while radiation in the green and near-infrared portion of the spectrum is reflected. Therefore, the reflectance captured in color-infrared photos can be used to distinguish between areas of live trees and dead trees (see the figure below). Satellite images do not contain the detail of aerial photos, but they allow us to track the reflectance of an area, known as the spectral trajectory, over time. The changes in a spectral trajectory provide clues as to the condition of forest with regard to mountain pine beetle activity.</p>
<p>This project is a critical first step in our overall goal to identify the ecological consequences of the interactions of bark beetles with subsequent fire events over the last several decades in the US Rocky Mountains. The work presents a quantitative application of remote sensing to forest disturbance and is timely given the recent mountain pine beetle outbreak throughout western North America. Furthermore, we believe the paper establishes a platform for future research of historical forest disturbance that would be very beneficial to the field of forest ecology.</p>

<p><strong><em>Manuscript Abstract</em></strong></p>
<p>Mountain pine beetles are significant forest disturbance agents, capable of inducing widespread mortality in coniferous forests in western North America. Various remote sensing approaches have assessed the impacts of beetle outbreaks over the last two decades. However, few studies have addressed the impacts of historical mountain pine beetle outbreaks, including the 1970s event that impacted Glacier National Park. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for outbreak severity. We incorporate historical aerial and landscape photos, aerial detection survey data, a nine-year collection of satellite imagery and abiotic data. This study presents a remote sensing based framework to (1) relate measurements of canopy mortality from fine-scale aerial photography to coarse-scale multispectral imagery and (2) classify the severity of mountain pine beetle affected areas using a temporal sequence of Landsat data and other landscape variables. We sampled canopy mortality in 261 plots from aerial photos and found that insect effects on mortality were evident in changes to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time. We tested multiple spectral indices and found that a combination of NDVI and the green band resulted in the strongest model. We report a two-step process where we utilize a generalized least squares model to account for the large-scale variability in the data and a binary regression tree to describe the small-scale variability. The final model had a root mean square error estimate of 9.8% canopy mortality, a mean absolute error of 7.6% and an R<sup>2 </sup>of 0.82. The results demonstrate that a model of percent canopy mortality as a continuous variable can be developed to identify a gradient of mountain pine beetle severity on the landscape.</p>
