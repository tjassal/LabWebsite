<p>The Winter Olympics begin on Friday. Sochi is located in southwest Russia at approximately the same latitude as Toronto, Canada; Marseille, France and Sapporo, Japan. To be exact, the games will take place in Adler, a district of the city that is is located 25 km from downtown Sochi. Adler is just a few kilometers from the Psou River which delineates Russia and Georgia and the nearby Caucaus Mountains have long been considered the boundary between Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>These Olympics are not without controversy (see any news outlet anywhere in the world for details). The host nation&#8217;s record on social issues, the astronomical cost, and the displacement of local residents are just a few of these stories. However, the games are being touted as the most compact in winter Olympic history.  A construction boom commenced after the winning bid was announced in July 2007. The venues are concentrated in a Coastal Cluster along the Black Sea shore in the Imeretinskaya Valley and a Mountain Cluster approximately 40 km up the valley in Krasnaya Polyana. I took a look at the land cover change associated with Olympic development in these two areas. I acquired a Landsat 5 image collected one month before Sochi received the news on their winning bid (late May 2007) and a Landsat 8 image from early November 2013. The images are displayed as false color images. Urban infrastructure appears bright gray and vegetation appears deep red. The 2007 image was obtained in late spring when forested areas have a higher level of photosynthetic activity resulting in a brighter red color compared to the mid autumn image of 2013.</p>
<p>Part of this work was featured by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in a fantastic photo journal: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/sets/72157640600081195/" target="_blank">NASA Goes to the Winter Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>A quick comparison reveals a largely agricultural area was transformed into the Coastal Olympic Cluster with the nearby Olympic Village and Rail Station with transport to the Mountain Cluster.  A spanking new breakwater structure was installed to create a harbor for cruise ships. The airport also received an expansion to handle the increased traffic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geography and sport are two of my favorite things. The Olympic venues are not only found throughout London, but across the entire United Kingdom. I only have time for a few highlights and I&#8217;m feeling spatially ignorant about these games. The official Olympic website has a very comprehensive interactive map, but it&#8217;s a bit overwhelming at the national scale. It turns out there are nine venues located outside of greater London which I define as the London Orbital (aka the beltway). Football will be played at five locations throughout the UK. Mountain Bike, Sailing, Rowing, Canoe Sprint and Canoe Slalom will all take place in southern England.</p>
<p>I was unable to find a map that quickly conveyed this information, but hopefully the one below will.</p>
