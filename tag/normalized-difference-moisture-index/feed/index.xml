								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will present research on drought-induced variability of sagebrush ecosystem productivity in the Upper Green River Basin at the <a href="http://wytwsconference.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyoming Chapter of The Wildlife Society Annual Meeting</a> in Jackson, WY. My presentation is part of the session entitled: <em>Grassland &amp; Sagebrush Environments</em>. We think this work is noteworthy because it deals with an important disturbance (drought) in an important habitat in the West (the Sagebrush Sea). Such a disturbance can have cascading effects on scores of species that live in the sagebrush ecosystem. The project could not have come to fruition without the collaboration of my partners at the Wyoming Game and Fish and the Natural Resources Conservation Service and funding from the <a href="https://www.wlci.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative</a>. I hope to submit the manuscript for publication shortly.</p>

<p>It was a great opportunity for me to communicate my research directly with natural resource managers. However, more importantly it was a chance to spend time in the field with people that really know these systems and begin to understand their needs and how our science might be able to help answer those questions. It was also a chance to get out of my comfort zone and interact with people that don&#8217;t spend all of their time thinking about spatial ecology.</p>

<p><em><strong>A key component of the research is our ability to connect what we see on the ground with what we see from the sky via satellite imagery.</strong></em> I had a chance to demonstrate the use of the hemispherical (or fish-eye) imaging system in the field and</p>

<p>thought I might expand on the process we used to link ground measurements and space based measurements. There are a number of ways to do this, but I&#8221;ll present our method here. In a recent study, (Assal et al. 2016) we measured forest canopy condition on the ground via a network of fish-eye photographs designed to measure the amount of leaves, branches and stems in the forest canopy. This metric is known as plant area index (Pfeifer et al., 2012) which can be derived from the fish-eye photos via a gap-fraction inversion procedure (Campbell and Norman, 1989) which measures the amount of radiation transmission through the canopy (Martens et al., 1993).</p>
<p>We used Landsat imagery (30 meter spatial resolution) that was collected from a satellite at the same time as our field campaign. To adequately sample the forest canopy, we established a grid of nine photo points in a sample plot, coincident with a Landsat pixel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1303" style="width: 905px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.timassal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sample1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-1303 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.timassal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sample1.jpg?resize=474%2C199" alt="dfdfdfdfd" width="474" height="199" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.timassal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sample1.jpg?w=905&amp;ssl=1 905w, https://i2.wp.com/www.timassal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sample1.jpg?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.timassal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sample1.jpg?resize=768%2C322&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1303" class="wp-caption-text">Left: Plot based sampling design for derivation of vegetation structure traits in a 30 meter Landsat pixel.

<p>The information from each plot was used to identify a linear relationship between the amount of plant material on the ground and the amount of plant material measured from the satellite (the Normalized Difference Moisture Index was used as a proxy for amount of plant material). Each point in the figure below represents the information obtained from the nine fish-eye photos taken at each sampling location (figure, above left).</p>

<p>We recently published an open access paper in the journal <em><a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/forest-ecology-and-management/" target="_blank">Forest Ecology and Management</a>,</em> entitled &#8220;Spatial and temporal trends of drought effects in a heterogeneous semi-arid forest ecosystem.&#8221; This is our second paper from this study which took place in southwestern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado. <a href="https://tjassal.github.io/LabWebsite/?p=984" target="_blank">We published a paper in 2015</a> mapping forest functional type across the forest-shrubland ecotone, which represents important habitat for a host of species.</p>

<p>The study area experienced a relatively dry period since 2000, while 2002 and 2012 were both extreme drought years. However, little attention has been given to the effect of top down climatic controls on the condition of the forest across the region. Recent drought-related mortality of aspen has been documented in western North America (Michaelian et al., 2011; Worrall et al., 2008) and multiple studies have documented an increase in mortality rates of coniferous species throughout the western United States over the later part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (van Mantgem et al., 2009). This prompted the question:</p>
<p><em>What are the spatial and temporal trends of recent drought in a forested ecosystem expected to be vulnerable to climate change?</em></p>

<p>We had no baseline data or long-term plots in the area, so we turned to the remote sensing archive to determine if drought altered forest structure over the course of a decade-and-a-half. We analyzed 22 years of Landsat satellite data to determine changes in forest condition between 1985 and 2012. The driving concept of the analysis was to assess the relationship between recent satellite imagery and the condition of vegetation on the ground; then backcast the relationship over the last thirty years to determine when and where change occurred. We assessed the relationship between plant moisture (a proxy for plant productivity derived from satellite data) and a number of ground based measurements.</p>

<p>In one set of measurements we used hemispheric or fisheye photos to measure the amount of aboveground plant material in a plot. Our results indicate there is a strong linear relationship between the amount of plant material on the ground and plant moisture measured from a satellite.</p>

<p>We hypothesized the long-term trajectory of plant moisture could be used to identify areas of forest that are resistant, persistent or vulnerable to severe drought. To do this, we ran simultaneous regression analyses for every 30 square meter Landsat pixel (upwards of 100,000 regressions) that incorporated plant moisture as the dependent variable and time as the explanatory variable. We then mapped the direction of the slope in each regression equation across the study area to identify trends in forest condition.</p>

<p>Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live tree density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. We can use this information to analyze individual forest stands and analyze the timing of changes in the plant moisture trajectory.</p>

<p>Our results identify areas of forest that are resistant, persistent or vulnerable to severe drought. The analysis gives natural resource managers a long-term perspective of the forest dynamics of this ecosystem and could inform treatment options or monitoring efforts. The spatial data generated from the analysis gives managers a glimpse into the recent past and it may hold clues as to how this system will respond to projected climate change. Our framework relies heavily on open access satellite data and could be applied to long-term monitoring of similar ecosystems.</p>

<p><em><strong><a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/82817" target="_blank">Spatial and Temporal Trends of Drought Effects in a Heterogeneous Semi-Arid Forest Ecosystem (B53F-0631)</a></strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Drought-induced forest mortality has been documented across genera in recent years in western North America. Understanding patterns of mortality and plant response to severe drought is important to resource managers, given the frequency of these events are expected to increase in the future. Remote sensing studies have documented changes in forest properties due to direct and indirect effects of drought; however, few have addressed this at local scales needed to characterize highly heterogeneous ecosystems in the forest-shrubland ecotone. We analyzed a 22-year Landsat time series (1985-2012) to determine changes in forest that experienced a relatively dry decade punctuated by two years of extreme drought. We assessed the relationship between vegetation indices and field measures, applied the index to trend analysis to uncover the location, direction and timing of change, and assessed the interaction of climate on topography. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) had the strongest correlation with plant area index (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64) and canopy gap fraction (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65). During the study period, 25% of the forested area experienced a significant (p &lt; 0.05) negative trend in NDMI, compared to less than 10% in a positive trend. Trends were not consistent across forest type as a larger amount of coniferous forest was impacted by negative trends than deciduous forest. Southern aspects were least likely to exhibit a negative trend and north aspects were most prevalent. Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. Our analysis identifies spatially explicit patterns of long-term trends anchored with ground based evidence to highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent and vulnerable to severe drought. The results provide a long-term perspective for the resource management of this area and can be applied to similar ecosystems throughout western North America.</p>
