								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The open access journal <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Sensing</a> has a call for papers related to remote sensing of wildfire. The topics of interest are diverse, ranging from wildfire risk to the ecological effects of fire. Full details can be found <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing/special_issues/wildfire_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Wildfires (which include forest fires, grass fires, brush fires, bush fires, and peat fires, among others) are an integral part of so many ecosystems across the world. In general, these fires are primarily viewed negatively despite their favorable contributions. Here, the purpose is to gather scientists/researchers related to this topic, aiming to highlight ongoing research investigations and new applications in the field. In this framework, the editors of this Special Issue would like to invite both applied and theoretical research contributions; submissions of original works furthering knowledge concerned with any aspect of the use of remote sensing in wildfires. Note that these manuscripts must be, not only unpublished, but also not under consideration for potential publication elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts must employ one of the following remote sensing data types: Optical, thermal, hyperspectral, active and passive microwave acquired by either airborne or spaceborne remote sensing platforms, dealing with wildfires. The topics of interest include, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehending of the pre-fire conditions,</li>
<li>Forecasting of wildfire danger/risk,</li>
<li>Modelling of wildfire behavior,</li>
<li>Fighting the wildfire,</li>
<li>Modelling prescribed burning,</li>
<li>Relation between vegetation phenology and fire,</li>
<li>Monitoring of the vegetation recovery following the fire events,</li>
<li>Mapping of burn area and ecological impacts,</li>
<li>Modelling of smoke propagation, and</li>
<li>Analyzing of historical fire regimes, among others.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a co-author on a new paper in the journal <em>Rangeland Ecology and Management</em> available at <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-12-00178.1" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-12-00178.1</a></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<p>Public land management agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), are charged with managing rangelands throughout the western United States for multiple uses, such as livestock grazing and conservation of sensitive species and their habitats. Monitoring of condition and trends of these rangelands, particularly with respect to effects of livestock grazing, provides critical information for effective management of these multiuse landscapes. We therefore investigated the availability of livestock grazing-related quantitative monitoring data and qualitative region-specific Land Health Standards (LHS) data across BLM grazing allotments in the western United States. We then queried university and federal rangeland science experts about how best to prioritize rangeland monitoring activities. We found that the most commonly available monitoring data were permittee-reported livestock numbers and season-of-use data (71% of allotments) followed by repeat photo points (58%), estimates of forage utilization (52%), and, finally, quantitative vegetation measurements (37%). Of the 57% of allotments in which LHS had been evaluated as of 2007, the BLM indicated 15% had failed to meet LHS due to livestock grazing. A full complement of all types of monitoring data, however, existed for only 27% of those 15%. Our data inspections, as well as conversations with rangeland experts, indicated a need for greater emphasis on collection of grazing-related monitoring data, particularly ground cover. Prioritization of where monitoring activities should be focused, along with creation of regional monitoring teams, may help improve monitoring. Overall, increased emphasis on monitoring of BLM rangelands will require commitment at multiple institutional levels.</p>
